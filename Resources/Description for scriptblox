Budgie Hub Universal 2 is here.

Sorry about the previous version of the script — there was a bug with the Orion library that prevented interacting with the menu when you were playing on a PC. Also, many functions in the "Game" tab didn't work because I rushed it and pasted random scripts I found
But after a year I decided why not make a second version of the hub with fixes and switch to the Fluent library, since from your feedback I realized the first one turned out pretty bad. In the Main tab I added a TextBox to search for other functions and sections, but it work in progress.
I decided not to make a separate tab for game-specific scripts, so the script detects which place you're playing and will offer to run a script made specifically for that game, run the universal script, or not run anything at all. I'll personally create the scripts for those modes, but I should warn you I probably won't fix them if they have bugs or maybe I will, but no promises. It’s a hard to write scripts on a phone when working alone.
